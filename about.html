    At Victorian Cybernetics we aim to improve the medicine business with our industrial grade surgical machines. Our machines have over 40 cameras, on it's arms, and even its LiDAR sensor. Our medical equipment has been approved by hospitals and medical profesionals all over the world. Our machines have performed over 25,000 surgeries worldwide, each one, according to customers, "5 stars, painless afterwards". Our machines are so precise it didn't just perform surgery on a grape, but a grape cell, with almost little to no human assistance.
    The reason our machines are 5 star rated from almost every customer is because our machines are effective and quick, a complicated heart surgery which would take upwards of 9 hours would take our machines 1 hour, even as something as complicated a neurosurgery, our machines are fully loaded and have prewritten surgery programs.
